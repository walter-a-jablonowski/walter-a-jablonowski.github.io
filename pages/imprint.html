          <h2>Exclusion of liability</h2>

          <p class="lead">1. Liability for content</p>

          <p>
            The content of my website was created with the greatest possible care. However, I do not guarantee that this content is correct, complete and up-to-date and that you also like it. According to § 7 Abs. 1 TMG I am responsible for the content, even if it was ordered.<br />
            <br />
            In accordance with §§ 8, 9 and 10 TMG, I am under no obligation to monitor information from third parties that have been transmitted or stored.<br />
            <br />
            Not affected by this is my obligation to block or remove information resulting from general laws.<br />
            <br />
            However, I am only in the moment in which I get to know of a specific violation of rights. Then an immediate removal of the corresponding content is made.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">2. Liability for links</p>

          <p>
            My website contains links that lead to external websites of third parties, on whose contents I have no influence. It is therefore not possible for me to guarantee this content.<br />
            <br />
            The responsibility for this always lies with the respective provider / operator of the corresponding website. I check the websites I link to at the time of linking to a possible full-scale infringement.<br />
            <br />
            However, I can not be expected, without a specific clue, to constantly monitor the content of the linked websites. However, if I become aware of an infringement, I will immediately remove the link.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">3. Copyright</p>

          <p>
            The content contained on my website is, as far as possible, protected by copyright. It requires the written permission of the creator for the person who duplicates, works on, distributes or uses the contents.<br />
            <br />
            The downloading and copying of my website is allowed for both private and commercial use by me in writing. I point out that I have respect for the content on my website, as far as they have not been created by me, the copyright of third parties at any time.<br />
            <br />
            If you told me that you still found copyright infringement, I would appreciate that. Then I can remove the content immediately and would thus no longer infringe copyright, so do not continue an unlawful state.
