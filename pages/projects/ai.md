Can you make a new project page (index.html) in the sales-assistant-2 folder?

Make the page is similar to this existing one: src\pages\projects\ninja-snipp\index.html

Content:

- Headline
- Lead paragraph: AI-Powered Natural Language Database Query Interface
- Short summary (from summary.md)
- Project image (img.png)
- Summary (use the content of src\pages\projects\sales-assistant-2\summary.md)

Make it looking good with the design of our webpage.
