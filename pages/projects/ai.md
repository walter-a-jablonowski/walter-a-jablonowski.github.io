I want to make a detail project page for the NinjaSnipp app from project-cards. I provided the content in NinjaSnipp.md in markdown.

- Please make a page in the that looks similar to samples.html and uses the style of this webpage
- Convert the content of NinjaSnipp.md to good looking html
  - don't alter the content itself, also don't add new content
  - just make sure that the html looks good
